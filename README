Package for using GPTwoSample
=============================

This module allows the user to compare two timelines with respect to diffferential expression.

It compares two timeseries against each other, depicting whether these two
timeseries were more likely drawn from the same function, or from
different ones. This prediction is defined by which covariance function :py:class:`pygp.covar` you use.

Examples:
Please see 'ready-to-use' example scripts in ./gptwosample/examples.
To see for example GPTimeShift example run:

sh gptimeshift_example.sh

The Output will be saved in gptimeshift_example/ with plots and results.csv. If you don't have sh, you can still run the script by modifying the scripts via "chmod -x gptimeshift_example.sh" and then run it by "./gptimeshift_example.sh"

Make shure to run "python ./examples/generateToyExampleFiles.py" to generate toy data for examples, if they are not present.
